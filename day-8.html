    <h2>Day 8 & 9</h2>
    <p>I have completed my first completely independent project using as much knowledge as I could at this stage.  I was really hard work and a steep learning curve.  It has left me feeling like I have made loads of progress but the more 
        I do, the more I realise how much there is to learn which can be overwhelming. I found I needed to go back over functions and arrays in particular...and used a lot of them. I'm certain there are better ways of coding what I have 
        done. I haven't really spent any time yet going over and tidying up. One of my bigger questions is, I wonder if I should be storing answers into objects? It certainly feels like things could be neater.  I also really wanted to only use the feedback sentence "For Question 1 you answered....bla bla bla" only once.  
        I tried to use the count value in an array within a string interpolation....   `bla bla bla ${array[count]}` but it did not like this and returned undefined.  I spent a while on this and googling but couldn't get an answer.  More knowledge needed! Still, I feel a sense of achievement because it works (and it was hard)!!</p>
