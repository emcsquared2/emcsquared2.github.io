        <h2> Day 3 - What have I achieved?</h2>
        <ul id="list"><img id="laptop-image" src="./resources/images/laptopWork.jpg" alt= "hands on laptop">
            <li>I started the day by getting some more storage data on my MS account.  I realised I should probably make sure my new HW website was properly backed up, as it would be a good way to look back in the future and track my development.  It's also helpful to reflect on acheivement at the end of the day.  This of course meant I had to reclone my repository after moving my folder but it worked fine.  Again, I had to exercise patience, as this took about 5 mins for it to go live (as I wondered if I had messed something up)
            <li>Created a navbar and logo</li>
            <li>Messed around with text styles, colour gradient, padding and learnt how to put in the copyright symbol &#169</li>
            <li>For now I have replicated the navbar across all my pages but I know from googling that there are other ways of doing this without having to repeat the code.  I'm going to park that for now though until I can expand my knowledge.</li>
            <li>Feels like I'm operating at an understanding of about 80-90%.  It has been a lot of fiddling and googling which as been fun although I have had enough of style editing for now and looking forward to getting practical with JS. </li>
